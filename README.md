## 1. Introduction
This repository is meant for a Frontend web application for an expense tracker application.

**Link for backend application:** https://github.com/nahwu/expense-app-backend


## 2. Purpose
While there are many expense trackers out there. The good ones are mostly behind a paywall. 
There is also the 
**Knowledge** of your own expenses is very crucial to our personal financial health for both the present and the future.
It only takes 20 average medium-sized spending (e.g. $50) within a month to reach 4 figure expense (>= $1000) for the month.
It's not uncommon to know someone who spends beyond their means, especially when one suddenly have more income than before. 

The goal is to begin with expense awareness and then expand to expense budgeting >> saving & networth projection >> retirement planning

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
